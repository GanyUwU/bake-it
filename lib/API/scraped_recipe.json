(We have the same name lol) I have made this well-over 5 times already (with cream and not egg whites), and it tastes amazing!! Although, I have one recurring issue which I hope you can help me with.. I have made this in smaller single-serve cups, as well as the full batch in a 6\" square container. I always find that my tiramisu melts very quickly. Especially in my 6\" batch, the cream firms up at the sides, but not at the center (when I shake the container, you can see the cream \"wobble\") Is there a way to fix this? Maybe to add more cream, or to make it half egg whites, and half cream? Or maybe it's just the weather at my place (Malaysia).. I have even tried whipping my cream and mascarpone together in an ice bowl, and it would still melt very quickly after I set my tiramisu. I am sure the cream is NOT over-mixed. I hope you can help me with this! I admire the dedication you put into your website. Your recipes are great ðŸ™‚ Reply Zoha says July 10, 2024 at 1:29 pm Hi Mariya! It sounds like you may not be whipping the cream long enough. And are you making any ingredient substitutions? Reply Susan says March 24, 2025 at 3:30 pm Tiramisu is one of my all-time favorite desserts and this was my first time making it myself. (I did add a little espresso powder to the cream while folding in, for a little extra coffee kick.)  This recipe was so easy to follow and it was absolutely delicious. Itâ€™ll be my go-to from now on! Reply",
